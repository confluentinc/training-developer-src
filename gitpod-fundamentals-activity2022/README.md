"Gitpodify" a kafka tutorial

## Kafka Tutorials

I'm taking the [Console Producer and Consumer Basics](https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/kafka-console-consumer-producer-basics/kafka.html) tutorial and "gitpodifying" it. In other words, I'm creating a one-click lab experience using [https://gitpod.io](Gitpod) as a remote development environment.

## Instructions

First, open the lab environment in Gitpod!

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/doughogan/fun-gitpod)

Then, follow the [Kafka Tutorial instructions](https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/kafka-console-consumer-producer-basics/kafka.html#create-a-topic) from step 3 (create a topic).

Have fun!
